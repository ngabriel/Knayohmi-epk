Knayohmi (Naomi Gabriel) is a UK-based House DJ whose groove-led, soulful and techy sets are rooted in funk, disco and rhythm-driven club culture. Based between Croydon and Colwyn Bay, her sound reflects both London’s underground energy and a deep musical heritage shaped by Motown, disco, soca and calypso.

Raised in a home where music was ever-present, Knayohmi grew up listening to her parents’ records and watching Diana Ross and Tina Turner concert VHS tapes on repeat. This early exposure to performance, rhythm and soul laid the foundation for a lifelong relationship with dance music and the dancefloor. She began DJing in 2014, playing at friends’ parties and underground gatherings, developing her taste and instincts in intimate, community-driven spaces.
A major turning point came in 2024 with the formation of Stickyjam Music, a South London tech house club night built around fun, freshness and good energy. As resident DJ and part of the creative team behind the brand, Knayohmi helped shape the night’s identity, bringing together groove-led club music and a welcoming, high-energy atmosphere. At the same time, her long-running friends’ parties evolved into This Is My Culture, now one of London’s most vital grassroots raves.

Run by a collective of activists, This Is My Culture is a queer-led party celebrating sexual freedom, underground dance culture and radical self-expression. Knayohmi holds a residency at the party, including its iconic summer event at Hampstead Heath — a George Michael tribute held at the artist’s historic cruising ground. At the party, she brings her house-rooted sound into a wider spectrum of dance music, always centred on movement, joy and connection.
Across clubs, bars, outdoor spaces, festivals and queer venues, Knayohmi’s DJ style is built around groove rather than bangers. Her sets move fluidly between soulful house, rolling tech grooves and rhythm-heavy selections, creating journeys that prioritise flow, feeling and freedom. When people leave her dancefloor, she wants them to feel refreshed, happy and lighter than when they arrived.

With her sights now set on festival stages and international bookings, Knayohmi represents a new generation of UK DJs rooted in community, culture and real dancefloor experience.

Keep it moving. Keep it groovin’.
