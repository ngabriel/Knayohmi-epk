Knayohmi is a House DJ based between Croydon and Colwyn Bay, known for groove-led, soulful and techy sets rooted in funk, disco and rhythm-driven club music. Her sound draws from a deep musical heritage rooted in Motown, disco, soca and calypso, shaped further by growing up on 90s and 00s dance music.
She began DJing in 2014, playing at friends’ parties and underground gatherings, but it was in 2024 — with the launch of her own South London club night Stickyjam Music and the growth of grassroots rave This Is My Culture — that she became fully active on the scene. These two residencies marked a turning point, giving her the space to develop her sound, build community and focus seriously on her DJ career.
Through Stickyjam Music, a tech house-led club night built around fun, freshness and good energy, Knayohmi is both resident DJ and part of the creative force behind the brand. At This Is My Culture — a queer, activist-run grassroots rave celebrating sexual freedom and underground dance culture — she holds a resident slot, bringing her signature house sound to one of London’s most vital community-led parties.
Her sets are about movement and feeling good. Flowing between soulful house, rolling tech grooves and rhythm-driven selections, she creates journeys that leave dancefloors feeling refreshed, happy and uplifted. Whether playing clubs, bars, outdoor parties or queer spaces, Knayohmi’s focus is always the same: good music, real connection, and freedom on the dancefloor.
Keep it moving. Keep it groovin’.
